# Prototype Status

Product: Football Competition Results & Standings Manager  
Status: Working prototype v0.1.0, final clean-copy QA pending  
Last verified: 15 July 2026

## Verified Product State

The live master contains a populated eight-team competition and 28 fixtures.

- The Result Form is Published and linked to the master workbook.
- All Form-linked response tabs are hidden from the customer workflow.
- Create Fixtures contains 8 active teams and generates 28 fixtures.
- Reports shows 2 score-bearing Approved Results and 25 Open Fixtures.
- All 23 Checks return OK and Publishing Status is Ready to publish.
- Create Fixtures is Ready to review and all prepared rows are Ready to publish.

## Current Customer Interface

Visible sheets are Start Here, Setup, Teams, Venues, Create Fixtures, Fixtures, Result Review, Reports and Checks.

Hidden sheets are Form response tabs, Rules, Lookups, Official Results, Standings, Goal Scorers and Archive. Goal Scorers remains parked future scope. Automation Setup and Example Data were removed.

The workbook title and first page explicitly identify football and no longer expose the Product 001 code, prototype terminology, batch labels or developer-facing menu wording.

## Current Form And Automation

The installed bound script is v0.1.5.0. Apps Script v0.1.5.2 is prepared in the repository and must be installed to apply the Competition Tools menu, customer-facing dialogs, Football Match Result Submission wording and legacy review-decision migration.

The Form collects fixture, submitter, optional message and Match Status. Played collects two scores, Walkover selects Home team or Away team, and Postponed or Abandoned collects a reason.

Result Review stores submitted Match Status separately from Official Outcome. Played and Walkover can count as approved results. Postponed remains closed until the manager enters a new schedule and runs Reschedule Selected Fixture. Abandoned starts as Postponed for review and may be resolved according to the competition rules.

## Verified QA

Fixture generation, fixture publishing, per-copy Form creation, response-tab hiding, submission intake, duplicate resolution, approval, standings, Reports, both reset actions, multi-group generation, practical match-day scheduling and sequential multi-group scheduling have passed their defined tests.

The Batch 8A workbook migration preserved 28 fixtures, 25 open fixtures, existing review history and all 23 passing Checks. The rewritten Google Doc User Manual contains customer instructions only and no forbidden dash characters.

The User Manual formatting was repaired on 15 July 2026. Arial is applied throughout, the opening workflow uses a native numbered list, supporting instructions use native bullets, and operational labels use consistent subsection headings. The exported PDF embeds Arial successfully.

## Active Blocker

Install v0.1.5.2, rebuild the Form content once, then run the final ordinary-user protection and permissions test in a clean copy on 16 July 2026.

## Next Action

Complete the 90-minute clean-copy regression on 16 July. Use 17 July to close release-blocking QA and decide delivery ownership, permissions, support and the first distribution route. Do not begin packaging or public release until those gates pass.
